            <p>I was born in Coquitlam, BC, but moved to North Vancouver when I was really young, before moving to Port Coquitlam just at the end of Elementary School. I found my love of computers at Terry Fox Secondary through the IT class, and have since worked a lot with Blender, Unity and a bit of Paint.net to work on my own game and playing games like World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2 co-op in the months leading up to my time at BCIT.</p>
