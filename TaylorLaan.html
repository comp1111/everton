            <p>Taylor was born and raised in the city of Maple Ridge (and also Pitt Meadows but they're pretty much the same place). 
                His hobbies include playing video games, watching movies/television from all over the world, and listening to music, particularily Metal and Rap. After a prolonged break from higher education, he has decided to return to the CST program at BCIT from which he hopes to graduate in 2019. There's no particular avenue of computing that he's most interested in obtaining a career in yet, but hopefully he can make a decision in over the next two years. Needless to say, Linda's favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
