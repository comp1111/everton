            <p>Nicholas was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and moved to Vancouver after completing high-school in 2014.
                Nicholas loves playing video games and watching TV shows in his spare time. He is also a massive sports fan, watching a lot of basketball and soccer. He has always been interested in learning more about coding and decided to pursue a career in software development, which led to him starting the CST program at BCIT.
                Needless to say, Nicholas' favorite course is COMP1111.</p>
