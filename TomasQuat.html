            <p>Tomas is self-proclaimed "King Goofball" that takes, well, just about everything with a light hearted manner,
			always looking for things to laugh about. Tomas spends his pensive afternoons reading, playing chess, spending time with
			friends and family, or simply lost in thought.</p>
