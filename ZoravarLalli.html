            <p>Zoravar was born and raised in the neighbourhood of Fleetwood in Surrey, BC.
                His hobby's include sitting infront of a computer all the time. This is why he has joined the Computing Department
                at BCIT where he hopes to graduate with a B-Tech degree in 2020. Zoravar is open to all types of programming but his overall goal is to be able to imagine a product and have the coding knowledge necessary to make it a reality. Zora's favorite part about CST is falling asleep to Bruce's soothing lectures.</p>
