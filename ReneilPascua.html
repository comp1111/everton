            <p>This unbelievably handsome man was born in the Philippines and moved to Vancouver to start off the new millenium. Interestingly enough, this marked the first time he wore more than a t-shirt and flip flops outdoors.</p>
            <p>Fast forwarding through the very awkward elementary and high-school phases, Reneil studied Physics at UBC. Fast forwarding through the slightly less awkward UBC phase, Reneil is now studying CST at BCIT. He hopes this trend continues.</p>
            <p>Reneil has a wide range of work experience, from blasting carbon fiber with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875389216302140">lasers</a>, to hand-delivering <a href="http://www.riverrock.com/casino/slots/">massive loads</a> of ca$h. On top of that, Reneil has tested sensitive equipment for <a href="http://www.triumf.ca/research-program/research-topics/detector-development">TRIUMF</a>, extensively using Python and this weird language(?) called <a href="https://root.cern.ch/"> ROOT </a>(developed by CERN).</p>
            <p>Hobbies of Reneil include: long walks on the beach, playing sports, scrolling through reddit, and being on time for class. Some of these hobbies are more difficult than others, unfortunately.</p>
            <p></p>
